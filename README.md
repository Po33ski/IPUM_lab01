# Production-Ready ML Application
This project guides you through building a production-ready machine learning application from the ground up. I'll introduce you to essential MLOps best practices and fundamental tools used in real-world ML projects, culminating in a local server providing ML model predictions.

Here's what this project covers:

### Dependency Management: Leveraging uv for efficient and reliable dependency handling.
### Code Versioning: Mastering Git and GitHub for collaborative and controlled development.
### Pre-commit Hooks: Implementing automated checks to maintain code quality.
### Configuration & Environment Variables: Managing application settings effectively.
### Secrets Management: Securely handling sensitive information with sops.
### Testing: Ensuring the robustness and correctness of your code and models.
### FastAPI Webserver: Building a high-performance API for your ML model.
### Serving ML Model: Deploying your trained model for inference.
### Containerization: Packaging your application with Docker and Docker Compose for consistent environments.
